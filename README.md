# AI-Enabled-Visa-Status-Prediction-and-Processing-Time-Estimator

Module 1 - Data Collection & Pre-Processing 

This module prepares the raw visa dataset so it can be used for machine learning.

- Loaded the dataset  
- Converted date columns into proper datetime format  
- Calculated visa processing time in days  
- Converted text columns into numeric one-hot encoded columns
  
This cleaned the data and made it ready for machine learning


Module 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This module analyzes visa processing time patterns and extracts meaningful insights from the dataset.

- Analyzed statistical distribution of visa processing time
- Visualized processing time using histogram, boxplot, and scatter plots
- Examined seasonal trends using application month and peak/off-peak categorization
- Studied correlation between application month and processing duration
- Computed country-wise and visa-type-wise average processing times
- Engineered EDA-driven features for downstream modeling

This analysis provided insights into trends, variability, and factors affecting visa processing time
